# Sosmad - Social Network Demo App

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Sosmad, a social network demo app built as a personal project to practice building custom widgets and project structure. In this project, I utilized several libraries such as `google_nav_bar`, `google_fonts`, `faker`, and `flutter_staggered_grid_view`.

ðŸ’¡ Please note that this is just the design without any backend capabilities. Feel free to add your own functionalities!

ðŸ“± The Sosmad app features a sleek and modern design, but it is important to note that the design is not mine. The design was found on Dribbble at this link: https://dribbble.com/shots/18340567-Sosmad-Social-Media-App
